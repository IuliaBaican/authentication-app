# Authentication app
This project is a single page application made using React Router. It was created as practice for user authentication. The authentication is done using a token, that is generated by a dummy backend. Depending on whether the user is logged in or not, they have acces only to certain pages. 
For example, if the user is not logged in, they can't add a new event or edit an existing one.
